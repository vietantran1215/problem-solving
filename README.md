# INSTRUCTION

## Installation
First, please clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/vietantran1215/problem-solving-with-js.git
```
Then, move to inner folder and install the dependencies
```
cd problem-solving-with-js
npm install
```

Now you can run the test of all my coding exercises

Currently, there's only guide for running tests in Visual Studio Code available. I will provide guide for running test in Webstorm later ^^

Because this repository contains lots of exercises and their tests, I highly recommend you to install this extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner
